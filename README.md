# Jenkins and Ansible 

For the next part in my course, tutor has installed Ansible inside our jenkins container. And seems like it we will use this tool a lot and i guess this tool is used mostly for ssh jobs. Our current containers are like this:

 - **jenkins**: Which has ansible inside it.
 - **mysql**: Which  
 - **remote-host**: Which we are trying to do jobs through this host for better practice.

Ansible uses inventory for controlling jobs(in our case its ssh). So we just created a ansible inventory like this:

    [all:vars]

    ansible_connection = ssh

    [test]
    test1 ansible_host=remote-host ansible_user=remote_user ansible_private_key_file=/var/jenkins_home/ansible/remote-key

### What this codes do?

As I understand that ansible has its own syntax in order to understand the commands. Here we are telling ansible how to connect and what settings to use. In order to understand inventories, we have to know that **hosts files are our inventories**

According go ChatGPT this is mostly the best practice considering real-world projects:

With `[all:vars]` we are declaring global variables that will be used in the hosts file. By the way hosts files are our inventories. 

With `ansible_connection = ssh` we are telling to the ansible that we will be using SSH to connect to the Hosts.

With `[test]` we are defining group.

After that we are telling ansible what should our hosts name should be which is `test1`. Note that while using this hosts, we can easily access this host via this name.

Then all we have to do in the last line is to manage our host's information in a way that ansible accepts them.
    
    test1 ansible_host=remote-host ansible_user=remote_user ansible_private_key_file=/var/jenkins_home/ansible/remote-key

### What is an Ansible Playbook?

An Ansible Playbook is a YAML file used to automate tasks on remote systems.
It tells Ansible what to do, on which hosts, and how to do it. Ansible uses inventory files to determine which machines to connect to, typically over SSH.

We creatd a simple playbook to run basic script like this:

    - hosts: test1
    tasks:
        - shell: echo Hello World > /tmp/ansible-file

This file takes a hosts name for it to connect. And then we specify the tasks section in order to give some assignment. Here we created a simple shell script that prints out "Hello World" and writes in into the machine. Here is the question, which machine does this text gets writed on? 

Is this code works on our machine or the host's itself? The answer is host's. Ansible connects to the remote host via SSH and executes the commands on that remote host â€” not on the control machine (your local machine or Jenkins container).
